        <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
        <p>A common React programming pattern is to use a parent
            stateful component to manage state and define state updating methods. Then, it will render stateless child
            components.
            One or more of those child components will be
            responsible for updating the parent state (via methods
            passed as props). One or more of those child
            components will be responsible for displaying that state.</p>
            <p>Here is a snippet code that Menu.js is a stateless component and will update the state of its parent component</p>
