## Description
My big cheatsheet in programming. I am improving and completing this collection of cheatsheet every week by learning new things. I hope you will find it useful.

## Why cheatsheet is important in programming?

*Asked ChatGPT*

A cheatsheet in programming is a concise reference guide that provides quick access to commonly used syntax, functions, commands, and concepts in a particular programming language or framework. Here are some reasons why cheatsheets are important:

1. **Efficiency:** Cheatsheets save time and effort by providing a condensed overview of essential information. Instead of searching through lengthy documentation or tutorials, programmers can quickly refer to a cheatsheet to find the specific syntax or command they need.

2. **Learning aid:** For beginners, cheatsheets serve as helpful learning aids. They provide a structured overview of the language's key elements and help programmers understand the basics more easily. Cheatsheets often include examples and explanations that aid in comprehension.

3. **Memorization support:** Programming languages can have complex syntax with numerous functions and commands. Cheatsheets act as memory aids, allowing programmers to quickly recall important details without having to memorize everything.

4. **Error prevention:** Mistakes in programming can be costly and time-consuming to debug. By using a cheatsheet, programmers can ensure they are using the correct syntax or function, reducing the likelihood of errors caused by typos or incorrect usage.

5. **Language-specific nuances:** Different programming languages have their own unique features, quirks, and best practices. A cheatsheet provides programmers with language-specific information that helps them write cleaner code and avoid common pitfalls.

6. **Quick reference during development:** During coding sessions, developers often need quick access to specific information like function parameters or available methods for an object/class. A cheatsheet allows them to find this information swiftly without interrupting their workflow.

7. **Portability:** Cheatsheets are usually available in printable formats or as digital documents that can be easily accessed on various devices like laptops, tablets, or smartphones. This portability ensures that programmers always have their reference material at hand regardless of their location.

In summary, cheatsheets play a vital role in programming by providing **quick access** to essential information, **aiding learning** and **memorization**, **preventing errors**, **supporting language-specific nuances**, serving as quick references during development, and offering **portability**. They are valuable tools for programmers of all levels and can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency.
