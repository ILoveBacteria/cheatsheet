### Monochromatic Designs

These monochromatic color schemes are beneficial in that they provide an organized impression when applied to your designs. The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of harmony.

### Complementary Designs

Complementary color schemes are popular on the web as they have high contrast in the color pairing.

They can seem clashing if complementary colors are used for large areas that are directly next to each other. However, when used strategically, they can draw attention to certain elements on the page that you want users to focus on.

### Analogous Color Schemes

Analogous color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display. For instance, the color blue can pair nicely with both teal and green. However, analogous color schemes provide a low-contrast experience, since all colors fall in line with one another.

They shouldn’t be used for content that needs the user’s direct attention, but they can be used to create backgrounds that do not compete with the main content of the site.

### Triadic Color Schemes

For instance, if we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select red-orange and yellow-green as the pairing combinations. This creates a triangle of colors within the color wheel and gives us a wider palette to choose from.

Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your designs.

## Default Colors

Pure black on white can be hard on the user’s eyes because of the stark contrast.

## Handwrite Notes

- A CSS rule that should be everywhere:
```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
