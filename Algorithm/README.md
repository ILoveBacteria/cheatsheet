## Searching Algorithms

### Sentinel Linear Search

The basic idea behind this algorithm is to add a sentinel value at the **end of the array** which is **equal** to the target value we are looking for. This helps to **avoid checking** the array boundary condition during each iteration of the loop, as the sentinel value acts as a stopper for the loop.
